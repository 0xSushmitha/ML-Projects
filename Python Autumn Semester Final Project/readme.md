# Wine Quality Analysis â€“ Introduction to Python Final Assignment

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts the quality of Portuguese red and white wines using statistical analysis and machine learning models. The dataset includes physicochemical attributes and quality scores, enabling a range of exploratory and predictive tasks.

---

## Concepts & Techniques Covered

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Descriptive statistics, histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps.
  
- **Statistical Testing**  
  Two-sample T-tests between red and white wine indicators.

- **Linear Regression**  
  Predicting wine quality using standardized predictors.

- **Feature Selection**  
  Forward selection using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

- **Random Forest Regression**  
  Predictive modeling, feature importance, and error analysis.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  MSE plots, real vs predicted plots, random state experimentation.

- **Clustering**  
  - K-Means Clustering (with Elbow Method for optimal `k`)
  - Agglomerative Clustering (using Silhouette Scores)
